        <p >
          Front-end development focuses on building the parts of websites and apps 
          that users see and interact with, primarily using HTML for structure, 
          CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. It encompasses layouts, 
          navigation, buttons, forms, animations, and responsive design so interfaces 
          work across devices and screen sizes. Front-end developers collaborate with designers
          and back-end engineers to turn mockups into performant, accessible user interfaces on 
          the client side. Modern front-end work often leverages frameworks and libraries (like React or Angular) 
          and connects to APIs, emphasizing usability, speed, and cross-browser compatibility

            Back-End
          </a>
        </h4>
        <p>
          Back-end development powers the server-side logic that drives websites and apps, handling data storage,
          business rules, authentication, and communication with external services. It typically uses languages and 
          frameworks like Node.js/Express, Python/Django or Flask, Java/Spring, Ruby on Rails, or Go, interfacing with 
          databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB. Back-end engineers design APIs (REST or GraphQL), manage security,
            authorization, and scalability, and ensure reliability through logging, testing, and monitoring. They optimize 
            performance with caching, queues, and efficient database queries, and deploy via cloud platforms, containers, 
            and CI/CD pipelines. Their work enables the front end to function securely, efficiently, and at scale.

      <div class="database">

            Database
          </a>
        </h4>
        <p>
          Databases store, organize, and retrieve application data reliably and efficiently, enabling persistence beyond runtime. 
          They come in relational (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server) and NoSQL forms (MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra), each optimized for
          different access patterns and consistency models. Relational systems use schemas, tables, and SQL with ACID transactions 
          for integrity, while NoSQL emphasizes flexibility, scale, or speed with key-value, document, column, or graph models. Good 
          database design applies normalization or purposeful denormalization, indexing, and constraints. Operations involve backups,
            replication, high availability, sharding, and monitoring. Security spans authentication, least-privilege roles, encryption, 
            and auditing. Performance tuning targets queries, indexes, caching, and connection pooling.

        <p>
          MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data as flexible JSON-like BSON documents, making it ideal for evolving
          schemas and hierarchical data. Collections replace relational tables, and dynamic documents eliminate rigid migrations. It supports
          rich queries, indexes (including compound and text), aggregations, transactions, change streams, and sharding for horizontal scale.
          MongoDB Atlas offers managed cloud deployment with backups, performance metrics, and security controls. Typical use cases include 
          content management, event logging, catalogs, and real-time apps. Developers access MongoDB via drivers or ODMs like Mongoose, 
          leveraging schema validation, middleware, and models to enforce structure while preserving flexibility and rapid iteration.

      <div class="express">
        <h4>Express.js</h4>
        <p>
          Express.js is a minimalist Node.js web framework for building APIs and server-side applications with routing, middleware, and HTTP 
          utilities. Its unopinionated design lets developers choose view engines, ORMs, and libraries. Core patterns include middleware chains 
          for logging, authentication, validation, and error handling. Routing supports parameters, query parsing, and modular routers. Express
           integrates easily with databases (MongoDB via Mongoose, SQL via Prisma/Sequelize) and authentication (JWT, sessions, Passport).
            Performance can be enhanced with compression, caching headers, and reverse proxies like Nginx. Robust apps add input validation 
            (Joi/Zod), rate limiting, security headers (helmet), and centralized error handling with consistent response formats.

      <div class="react">
        <h4>React.js</h4>
        <p>
        React is a declarative JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces using components and hooks. It renders efficiently
         via a virtual DOM, updating only what changes. JSX combines markup with logic, enabling reusable, composable UI pieces. State and 
         effects are managed with useState and useEffect, while context provides global state without prop drilling. React Router handles 
         client-side routing; libraries like React Query or SWR manage server state. Modern React emphasizes function components, accessibility
         , and performance through memoization, lazy loading, and code splitting. It powers SPAs and hybrid frameworks like Next.js for server 
         rendering, routing, data fetching, and SEO.

      <div class="node">
        <h4>Node.js</h4>
        <p>
         Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on V8, enabling server-side development with an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model ideal 
         for high-concurrency, I/O-heavy workloads. Its single-threaded event loop uses libuv to manage async operations efficiently, while
          worker threads and clustering handle CPU-bound tasks and multi-core scaling. The npm ecosystem offers vast packages for web servers, 
          databases, queues, and tooling. Node supports modern ECMAScript, ES modules, and TypeScript integration. Production apps rely on
           environment configuration, logging, monitoring, and process management (PM2, Docker, Kubernetes). Performance practices include 
           streaming, caching, connection pooling, and profiling to reduce latency and optimize throughput.
